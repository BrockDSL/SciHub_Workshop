This tutorial will use Python to analyze some usage data of the (in)famous platform [SciHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub). This tutorial is meant to give you an introduction to the main ideas behind data science by analyzing usage logs of the Sci-Hub website in the Niagara region.

All of the work for the tutorial uses Juypter Notebooks and Google Colab.
